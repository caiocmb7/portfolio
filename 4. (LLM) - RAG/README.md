# RAG Portfolio Project

This project serves as an implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for showcasing personal skills and projects. It is designed to demonstrate expertise in natural language processing and LLMs.

The RAG integrates state-of-the-art retrieval and generation techniques to provide an interactive and dynamic experience. It leverages a pre-trained transformer model to retrieve relevant information from a curated dataset and generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses.
